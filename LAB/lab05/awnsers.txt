 the code in 5-1 would be affected by chaning the while loop to a do while loop by always going through one iteration
 if you don't input any data and just use the -1 it shows that there was no data entered
 if you keep entering zeros then there it shows that there has been no rainfall
 the purpose for "if (month == 1)" is so that it ceatches that the user quit immideatly after running the code
 if you don't enter one of the letters in the menu it will just reitterate the menu making you stuck there untill you enter a lsited option.
it works exactly the same if you remove the "== True"
